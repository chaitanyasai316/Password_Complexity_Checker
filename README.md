# Password Strength Assessment Tool

This tool assesses the strength of a user's password and provides feedback on how to improve it. It evaluates the password based on its length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Features

- **Password Strength Scoring**: 
  - Rates passwords out of 10.
  - Categories: Very Weak, Weak, Medium, Strong, and Very Strong.
  
- **Feedback**: 
  - Offers suggestions to improve the password.
  - Identifies missing elements like digits, special characters, or length.
